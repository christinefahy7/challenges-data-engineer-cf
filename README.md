# Data engineering coding challenge

This is a technichal test for data engineering candidates at Glofox, this test was [originally designed by D2SI](https://github.com/d2si-oss/data-engineering-coding-challenge).

### Terms

Candidates should do this test on their own. It is designed to be done in 3 or 4 hours but there is no hard limit. Please upload your solution to any VCS like Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab, etc. and let us know the link to your repo.

Please make sure to include a README and any information you might think it's relevant of your project, including features that you'd like to implement if you feel that you were time-constrained.
